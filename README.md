# macros-ansys
Here I share some APDL macros for Ansys Mechanical

*Buckling thin walled beam* contains the macros to caculate the buckling force of a shell beam using nonlinear analysis. The forlder also contains a PDF with documentation on how to run the analysis, and explanation of some of the commands.

*Dispersion Analysis* contains the macros to obtain the dispersion curves of a square honeycomb (using solid elements and beam elements). There is also a PDF explaining how the simulations are run.
